                    I am a new software developer that dabbles in things like voice acting, making music, and designing video games.

                    I completed my Bachelor's of Science in Software Development in two and a half (2.5) years (Mar. 2020 - Sep. 2022). 
                    During that time I was running a business and raising a child with my wonderful wife, Amy. Now I fill my free time 
                    with the afore mentioned hobbies and continued learning.
