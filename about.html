                    Software Engineer at Global Federal Credit Union

                    My experience at the credit union has been very educational. While I currently support their online banking application and the buisness mobile banking application, I have had the opportunity to work on many other
                    applications and systems that have exposed me to Unix Command Line, Windows Command Line, C#, JAVA, JS, CSS, HTML, Legacy ASP, ASP, .NET, Xcode, and much more. Since I work mostly remote I have become adept at coordinating 
                    with my team via online methods (i.e. Teams, Zoom, Outlook, etc.).
